Hello,
This is a Converter application that I developed on Visual Studio 2019 using C#
It takes the metric in mm,cm,m,km and then after the press of the buttons in the middle, it converts the metrics to 
inches, yards and miles. 
I used a simple approach utilising basic C# concepts to code the functionality of the program.
The Reset button resets the program and the Exit button quits the program.
